# Semantic Web Experiment

> This repository contains my personal exploration and experiments in the field of the Semantic Web.  
> I started this project to better understand how structured data, ontologies, and reasoning can enhance the meaning and accessibility of web content.

## What is the Semantic Web?

The **Semantic Web** is an extension of the current web that enables machines to understand and interpret data with meaning (semantics). It leverages technologies such as:

- **RDF (Resource Description Framework)** – for modeling data as triples.
- **OWL (Web Ontology Language)** – for defining ontologies and class relationships.
- **SPARQL** – for querying semantic data.

By using these tools, data can be linked and queried in a way that mimics human understanding.

## About This Project

This project includes:

- Sample RDF datasets and vocabularies
- Custom ontologies modeled in OWL
- SPARQL queries to extract meaningful insights
- Notes and code samples using tools like Protégé, GraphDB,  Apache Jena, or RDFLib (Python) 
- Real-world use cases like knowledge graphs, linked data, or metadata enrichment

The purpose of this repository is purely educational, and I will continue adding new insights, code, and learnings as I explore further.
